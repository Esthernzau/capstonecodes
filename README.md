This project contains files for my Undergraduate Capstone Project where I developed an IoT safety device
for real-time location tracking.

I built a complete prototype of the system that had an alarm system and wireless communication.

The project can potentially reduce physical attacks significantly by allowing the user to request help within a press of a button and get prompt help from the remote monitoring centre.

Embedded technology and object-oriented programming using C was used for programming the microcontroller and determining system control. Other technologies used were LoRa communication, SolidWorks, wifi
